Accessibility in Web Development: Accessibility in web development refers to designing and coding websites in a way that ensures people with disabilities can perceive,
                                  understand, navigate, and interact with digital content effectively. It involves making web content inclusive and usable for everyone,  
                                  regardless of their abilities.

Importance of Accessible Websites-----
1.> Inclusivity and Equal Opportunities: Accessible websites promote inclusivity by providing equal access to information and services for everyone,
                                         regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

2.> Expanded Audience Reach: Making your website accessible broadens your audience. People with disabilities constitute a significant portion of the population,
                             and an accessible website allows you to reach and serve a larger user base.

3.> Enhanced User Experience: Accessible websites often result in a better user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.
                              Designing with accessibility in mind can lead to cleaner, more organized, and user-friendly interfaces.

4.> Adaptation to Diverse Technologies: Accessible websites are more likely to work well with a variety of devices and assistive technologies, such as screen readers,
                                        voice recognition software, and alternative input devices. This adaptability ensures a seamless experience for users with different
                                        needs and preferences.

5.> Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Demonstrating a commitment to accessibility is a positive aspect of corporate social responsibility. 
                                           It sends a message that your organization values diversity and is dedicated to making digital spaces accessible to everyone.
